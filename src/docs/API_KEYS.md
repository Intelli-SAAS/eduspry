# AI Model API Keys Guide

This document provides instructions on how to obtain API keys for the various AI models supported in our EduSpry platform.

## API Key Security

- API keys are stored only in your browser's local storage

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your API key:

1. Verify that the key is entered correctly without any extra spaces
2. Check that your API key is active and has not expired
3. Ensure your account has sufficient credits/quota for the selected model
4. Try regenerating a new API key if necessary
