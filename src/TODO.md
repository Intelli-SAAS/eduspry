# AI Integration Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating various AI models into the EduSpry platform.

## Current Status

- [x] Created UI for model selection
- [x] Implemented local storage for API key management
- [x] Added document export/download functionality
- [x] Added basic API key documentation

## Immediate Tasks

- [ ] Implement actual API calls to OpenAI GPT-4o
  - [ ] Create server-side proxy endpoint to protect API keys
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling for rate limits and token limits
  - [ ] Add streaming response support for better UX

- [ ] Implement Gemini API integration
  - [ ] Create adapter for Google AI API format
  - [ ] Add support for multi-modal inputs (text + images)

- [ ] Implement Claude API integration
  - [ ] Create adapter for Anthropic API format
  - [ ] Add support for longer context windows

- [ ] Implement DeepSeek models integration
  - [ ] Create adapter for DeepSeek API
  - [ ] Test performance for different educational content generation

## Medium-term Tasks

- [ ] Implement proper backend authentication for API access
  - [ ] Create JWT-based auth system for API requests
  - [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse

- [ ] Add model-specific prompts optimization
  - [ ] Create specialized prompts for each model
  - [ ] Fine-tune prompts for different educational contexts

- [ ] Implement proper error handling
  - [ ] Create fallback mechanisms when a model is unavailable
  - [ ] Add retry logic for transient errors

- [ ] Add usage tracking and analytics
  - [ ] Track token usage per model
  - [ ] Provide usage insights to administrators

## Long-term Tasks

- [ ] Implement fine-tuning capabilities for models that support it
  - [ ] Create UI for uploading fine-tuning data
  - [ ] Implement fine-tuning job management

- [ ] Add model comparison tools
  - [ ] Allow side-by-side comparison of outputs from different models
  - [ ] Provide quality/performance metrics

- [ ] Implement advanced export options
  - [ ] Add PDF export with formatting
  - [ ] Support export to Google Docs, Microsoft Word, etc.
  - [ ] Implement direct integration with LMS platforms

- [ ] Create admin dashboard for AI usage
  - [ ] Monitor and manage API usage across the platform
  - [ ] Set organization-wide policies and limits

## API Endpoint Structure

Future API endpoints should follow this structure:

```
POST /api/ai-assistant/generate
{
  "modelId": "gpt-4o",
  "type": "test|notes|mcq|doubts",
  "params": {
    // Type-specific parameters
    "subject": "physics",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    // etc.
  },
  "content": "Optional document content or question"
}
```

Response:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "content": "Generated content",
    "meta": {
      // Additional metadata
    }
  }
}
```

Or for errors:

```
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE"
}
```

## Notes for Implementation

1. All API calls should be made from the backend to protect API keys
2. Implement proper caching to reduce API costs
3. Consider implementing a queue system for handling large generation jobs
4. Ensure all user data is properly sanitized before sending to AI models
5. Add comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing purposes
